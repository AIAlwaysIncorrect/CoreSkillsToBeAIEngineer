# CoreSkillsToBeAIEngineer
The minimum skill set to become an AI automation engineer.

# **1️⃣ Python for Automation (Must Learn)**

You need Python skills to automate:

- email sending
    
- scraping
    
- reading excel
    
- writing SQL
    
- connecting APIs
    
- data transformation
    

**Learn:**

- `pandas`
    
- `requests`
    
- `beautifulsoup4` (basic scraping)
    
- `pydantic`
    
- `duckdb` (super beginner-friendly database)

# **2️⃣ LangChain or LangGraph (Agents Framework)**

This is the **heart** of building agents.

Learn these topics only:

### 🔹 Prompts → Chains → Tools → Agents → Memory

### What you should know:

- Tool calling
    
- Multi-agent workflow
    
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
    
- Using vector databases
    
- Input/Output parsers
    

This will allow you to build:

- Text-to-SQL agent
    
- Content repurposing agent
    
- Research agent
    
- Customer support agent
    
- Lead generation agent

# **3️⃣ LLM Models (Open-source + APIs)**

You need to understand **how LLMs work practically**, not theoretically.

Learn:

- How to use open-source models in **Ollama**
    
- Using API-based models (OpenAI/Google/Groq)
    
- How to choose a model
    
- Prompt engineering basics
    
- Function calling
    

That’s enough — you don’t need ML theory.

---

# **4️⃣ Databases (Easy Level)**

You will handle structured data, so databases are required.

Learn these:

### 🔹 DuckDB (for Excel → Database)

### 🔹 Postgres basics

### 🔹 ChromaDB (for vector search memory)

Skills needed:

- create table
    
- insert data
    
- select queries
    
- load CSV/Excel
    
- connect Python to DB
    

---

# **5️⃣ Backend (Small Level — Basic APIs)**

To deploy your AI agents, you need a backend.

Learn **FastAPI** (very beginner-friendly).

Learn:

- create routes
    
- accept form/file input
    
- run API locally
    
- return JSON responses
    

---

# **6️⃣ Frontend (Beginner-friendly UI)**

You do _not_ need React or HTML.

Learn just **Streamlit** — enough for dashboards & UI.

You will use it for:

- Text-to-SQL interface
    
- Research report generator UI
    
- Customer support agent demo
    
- Content repurposing dashboard
    

Streamlit makes UI very easy.

---

# **7️⃣ RAG Systems (Beginner Level)**

Required for customer support & market research agents.

Learn:

- embeddings
    
- vector search
    
- document loaders
    
- retrieval pipelines
    

Tools:

- ChromaDB
    
- LangChain RAG
    
- PDF summarization
    
- HTML → text extraction
    

---

# **8️⃣ Basic Tools Integration (High value)**

You need to know how to integrate with:

### 🔹 Email API (Gmail or Mailgun)

### 🔹 WhatsApp API (for support bots)

### 🔹 Calendar API

### 🔹 Simple scrapers (SerpAPI / Firecrawl)

These are almost always client requirements.

---

# **9️⃣ Deployment (No DevOps expertise needed)**

Learn these 2 simple deployment options:

### Option A: Streamlit Cloud (free)

### Option B: Render.com (cheap autoscaling)

### Option C: Docker + Railway (if needed)

You don’t need AWS/GCP at beginner stage.
